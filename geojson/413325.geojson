  "description": "Succosa was located between the Portus Cosanus and the Via Aurelia Antica to the north. It is mentioned in the Itineraries and located on the Tabula Peutingeriana. F.E. Brown suggests that Succosa, derived from \"sub-Cosa\", emerges in the first century B.C. following the decline of the hill-top colony. It may also be the \"Respublica Cosanorum\" that is mentioned in Severan inscriptions known from the hill-top town.",
