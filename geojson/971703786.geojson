  "description": "Fortified settlement in southern Georgia. The Samshvilde site is one of the oldest cities in Georgia, with remains from the Bronze Age Kura-Araxes Culture. Samshvilde was an important city in the late antique and medieval periods until it was sacked in 1440 by Jahan Shah; it went in decline but was inhabited as late as the 18th-19th centuries. The site includes a number of structures, including an 11th-13th century citadel, several early medieval churches, homes, and burial grounds.",
