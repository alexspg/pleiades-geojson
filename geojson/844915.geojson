  "description": "Robert argued for reading \"ἔμβολος\" in a fragmentary funerary epigram found in the area of Beyköy, Turkey, as a toponym. He argues, with reference to early travelers' accounts of antiquities in the area, for a nearby location for this putative settlement, probably up the gorge of the Ugursuyu.",
