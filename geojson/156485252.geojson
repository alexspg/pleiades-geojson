  "description": "Nineveh's western wall had seven (or eight) gates: the Desert Gate was the southernmost gate along that stretch of wall. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it sometime between 695 and 691 B.C. and he gave it the Akkadian ceremonial name Kadrê-Tēme-u-Sumuʾel-qerebša-irrub (\"The Presents of the People of Tēma and Sumuʾel Enter Through It\").",
