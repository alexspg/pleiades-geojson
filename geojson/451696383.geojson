  "description": "Subura (or Suburra) refers to an area of ancient Rome, although the precise spatial definition of this area is unclear. In the earliest instances, this toponym may refer to the valley lying between the Oppian and the Caelian. As such it corresponds to one of the four urban regions known as the \"Servian\" regions. In later times the Subura referred to a part of the Augustan regio IV which was known as a densely populated area between the Esquiline, Quirinal, Viminal, and Cispian hills and had a rough and seedy reputation.",
