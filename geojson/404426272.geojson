  "description": "The House of Aulus Umbricius Scaurus (Regio VII, Insula 16, entrances 12-15) is considered to be the residence and trading center of the gens Umbricia, a Pompeian family involved in producing and selling garum. The house itself is described as a \"Samnite-type\" house and in the first century B.C. it was most likely owned by the Samnite military commander Maras Spurnius who resisted the invasion of Sulla.",
