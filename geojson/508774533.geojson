  "description": "The eighth-century-BC Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC) had a temple to the god Nabû, the god of scribes, built in the citadel of his new capital, Dūr-Šarrukīn (modern Khorsabad). Building H is the largest temple in Sargon’s newly-constructed city and it was built on a platform in the western side of the citadel, rather than on the palace terrace. The Nabû temple was connected to the temple district, which formed part of Sargon’s royal residence, by a stone bridge.",
