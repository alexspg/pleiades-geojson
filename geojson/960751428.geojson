  "description": "Most 7th-century B.C. Assyrian inscriptions record that Nineveh had eight south- and east-facing gates: the Mullissu Gate was the fifth of these. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it and gave it the Akkadian ceremonial names Ištar-zāninki-kurbī (\"O Ištar Bless the One Who Provides for You!\") and Ša-Sîn-ahhē-erība-manzalti-ereqqi-kinnī-palêšu (\"Make Sennacherib's Dynasty as Firm as the Position of the Wagon Constellation!\").",
