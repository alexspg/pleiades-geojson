  "description": "Nineveh's western wall had seven (or eight) gates: the Step Gate of the Gardens was the third gate from the northern city wall. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it sometime between 694 and 691 B.C. and he gave it the Akkadian ceremonial name Igisigsig-mušammeh-ṣippāti, which means \"The God Igisigsig Is the One Who Makes Orchards Flourish.\" The gate is still unlocated, but, based on its everyday name Akkadian name mušlālum ša kirî (\"Step Gate of the Gardens\"), it must have led up to Sennacherib's Palace on the citadel, perhaps at the foot of the sloping passage Room LI of the South-West Palace.",
