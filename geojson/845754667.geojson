  "description": "Archaeological site near the modern settlement of Kabri in northern Israel. The site shows signs of occupation from the late Neolithic period and the Early (Ia-II) and Middle (IIA-B) Bronze Ages. The site was an important city in the Middle Bronze Age, rapidly expanding during the 18th century BCE with the construction of a rampart and one of the largest known Canaanite palaces. It was abandoned by about 1500 BCE, and later habitations (in the Iron Age, Hellenistic, and Ottoman periods) were of smaller scale. ",
