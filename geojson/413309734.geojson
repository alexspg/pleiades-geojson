  "description": "Pol-e Dokhtar (also Romanized as Pol Dokhtar and Pul-i-Dukhtar) is a city in the Lorestan Province of Iran. The ruins of a Sasanian bridge over the Kashkan River are still visible today a few kilometers north of the city; that structure was part of a Sasanian Royal road that connected the Persian capitals Istakhr and Bishapur with towns in central and northern Mesopotamia. In 1992, a horde of ancient objects were found in the nearby Cave Kalmakareh (also referred to as Cave Kalmakarra). ",
