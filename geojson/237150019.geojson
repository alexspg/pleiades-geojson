  "description": "The palace of the eighth-century-BC Assyrian Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC) at Dūr-Šarrukīn (modern Khorsabad), Egalgabarinutukua (\"Palace That Has No Equal\"), was constructed between 717 BC and 706 BC. This royal residence was constructed on a high, mud-brick terrace located within the city’s citadel, which was located against the northwestern stretch of the city wall. This large, ornately-decorated palace complex consisted of over two hundred rooms (including chapels to the deities Ea, Sîn, Ningal, Adad, Šamaš, and Ninurta) and courtyards, as well as a ziggurat.",
