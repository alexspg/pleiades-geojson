  "description": "Just a few kilometers upstream of the city, the 7th-century B.C. Assyrian king Sennacherib had an architectural complex built and several stele-like panels (with accompanying inscriptions) carved into a nearby cliff face. The site may have served as a summer residence for the Assyrian king and may have been used as a headquarters to supervise the construction of a vast network of canals and aqueducts that was created specifically for providing water to Nineveh and the Assyrian heartland. The \"Khinnis Reliefs\" were included on the 2014 World Monuments Watch to increase awareness of cultural heritage in the Khinnis/Bavian area.",
