  "description": "Ruins of an ancient town located in a now-uninhabited forest area near the modern Turkish town of KapaklÄ± in the Demre district of Antalya province. Its ancient name is known only from fragmentary epigraphic sources of the Hellenistic period, but archaeological investigation has demonstrated occupation and development from the 3rd century BCE through late antiquity, with some modest habitation continuing in the medieval period.",
