  "description": "Nineveh's western wall had seven (or eight) gates: the Barhalzi Gate was the sixth gate from the northern city wall. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it sometime between 694 and 691 B.C. and gave it the Akkadian ceremonial name Anum-nāṣir-napištīya, which means \"The God Anu Is the Protector of My Life.\" ",
