  "description": "Longula was an early settlement of Latium Vetus, although its location is no longer known. A Volscian city, Longula was first taken by the Romans in 493 B.C. under the consul Postumus Cominius. It subsequently changes hands several times during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. It likely lay between Ardea and Antium.",
