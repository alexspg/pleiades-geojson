  "description": "An opulent Roman villa maritima destroyed by the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius. The remains of an opulent and well-decorated Roman villa have been known at Positano since at least 1758 when ruins were discovered during work on the bell tower of the church of S. Maria Assunta. Karl Weber conducted excavations there in the same year. Modern work, begun in 1999, has stabilized and consolidated the site.",
