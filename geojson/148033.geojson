  "description": "A limestone quarry at Nîmes that is often referred to by the name of the hill into which it was cut. It is located just west of the Temple of Diana and north of the terminus of the Rue de la Càrriere Romaine. Modern structures have been built in and around the quarry and access is gated, but some of the excavated cliff faces are still visible from the terminus of the Rue du Rempart Romain.",
