  "description": "The hamlet of Malborghetto, located on the ancient Via Flaminia, is traditionally linked with Constantine the Great and his visions of victory that occurred prior to the battle of Saxa Rubra on 28 October A.D. 312. The quadrifons arch, dating to the fourth century, marks the intersection of the Via Flaminia and the Via Tiberina.",
