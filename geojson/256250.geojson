  "description": "Following TIR, the Barrington Atlas tentatively placed this ancient settlement at the archaeological site in Spain known today as Cerro del Cogolludo, which is located near the modern town of Navalvillar de Pela. Variants of the ancient placename are attested in inscriptions and in Ptolemy and Pliny. The latter two differ in provincial association, leading some scholars to speculate that two separate settlements with similar names existed in ancient times.",
