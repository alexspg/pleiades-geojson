  "description": "An archaeological site located in Afghanistan's Nimruz Province, some 25 km south of Lash Juwain. Materials on the site ate to the period between the ninth and thirteenth centuries. A large archaeological complex estimated at 9.5 by 13 km has been documented, containing numerous smaller sites. A large citadel is the primary feature of Peshwaran. It measured 200-300 m in diameter and had brick walls standing to 17 m in height. There were at least two large towers. According to Ball there has been no significant fieldwork since the works carried out in 1936 by the DAFA survey (Delegation Archaeologique Fran√ßaise en Afghanistan).",
