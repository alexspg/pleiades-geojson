  "description": "The Sabini (Sabines) were an Italic tribe of central Italy and belonged to the Osco-Umbrian language group. Their territory straddled parts of the modern regions of  Lazio, Umbria, and the Abruzzo. Ancient writers connect them with Rome at the time of its foundation, as represented by the episode of the 'rape of the Sabine women' reported by various ancient authors.",
