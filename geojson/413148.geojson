  "description": "Forum Novum was a Roman town and an early medieval bishopric. It is located in the Sabine hills and was likely founded as a market center during the Republican period. It had achieved the status of municipium by the first century A.D. The market center seems to have remained active until at least the fourth century and by the fifth century, a bishopric is established there.",
