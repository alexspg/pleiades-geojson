  "description": "The Montelabate estate of the Gaslini foundation has been investigated by means of both field survey and excavation. This upland area sits astride a frontier zone, one that separates Perugia (Etruria) from Gubbio (Umbria). Simon Stoddart, Maurizio Matteini Chiari, Gabriele Cifani, and other scholars have noted that this ancient frontier zone was in place by the fifth-fourth centuries BC and denotes the differential urbanism practices of Etruscans and Umbrians, respectively.",
