  "description": "The City of David is the name given in the 20th century to an archaeological site located in the Arab neighborhood of Wadi Hilweh, located south of the Temple Mount and the Ophel in East Jerusalem. The site contains pottery from as early as the Chalcolithic Age, and has been proposed as a possible original core of the city of Jerusalem. The Silwa necropolis, a burial site dated to the 9th-7th centuries BCE, is located within this area.",
