  "description": "A modern village on the Aegean island of Lesbos. Remains of ancient houses have been noted in the area. Its modern name may preserve an ancient toponym preserved on a late-antique inscription. For these reasons, BAtlas followed Kontes 1978 in identifying it as the general area of a late antique settlement.",
