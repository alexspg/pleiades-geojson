  "description": "An ancient city that was part of the Mitanni, Hittite, and Neo-Assyrian Empires (Kargamiš in Hittite; commonly Carchemish). The site was occupied as early as the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods; evidence for Early Bronze Age cist tombs begins ca. 2400 BC.  It was a key commercial center during the time of Ebla and Mari. The Mitanni controlled the site from the sixteenth to the fourteenth centuries and was conquered by Šuppiluliuma ca. 1350 B.C. A famous battle, attested in the Bible, was fought at the site in 605 BC between the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar II and that of the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II.",
