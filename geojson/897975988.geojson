  "description": "As part of transformation of Nineveh’s lower town at the beginning of the 7th century B.C., the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib created a broad royal road that ran all the way through the city. That fifty-two-cubit-wide road, whose ancient ceremonial name is not known, is still unlocated, but it is generally thought to have run north from the Aššur Gate, east past the armory and the citadel, to the Sîn Gate (formerly the Gate of the Gardens).
