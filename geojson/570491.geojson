  "description": "Mycenae was an ancient settlement of the Argolid, with the earliest occupation evident ca. 2900 BC. As the eponymous site of the Mycenaean culture of the Aegean Bronze Age, the site flourishes as a fortified citadel during the mid to late second millennium BC. In the first millennium BC, the site experiences a revival of fortunes, although by Strabo's time the settlement had vanished. ",
