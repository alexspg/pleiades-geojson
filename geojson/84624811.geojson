  "description": "A desert and mountainous region located between the Plateau of Iran and the Indian subcontinent, comprising the modern regions of southeastern Iran (Sistan and Baluchestan province), western Pakistan (Balochistan province), and southern Afghanistan (Nimruz, Helmand and Kandahar provinces). The region's name is derived from the Baloch people, who have inhabited the region since at least the ninth century CE. In antiquity, the southern part of the region, along the coast of the Arabian Sea, was known as Maka in the Achaemenid period and Gedrosia in the Hellenistic period.",
