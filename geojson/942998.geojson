  "description": "A linear fortification system, probably built in the Parthian period and used during the Sasanian period, the so-called \"Great Wall of Gorgan\" stretches almost 200 km from the east coast of the Caspian Sea to near the town of Pishkamar in modern Iran. If the fortification system had a name in antiquity, it has not survived.",
