  "description": "The so-called \"Garden of the Fugitives\" (I, 21,1) is an area of the city that was once given over to habitation but that in the final phase of the city was a vineyard with a summer triclinium. Excavation campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s discovered 13 human victims of the AD 79 eruption that destroyed the city.",
