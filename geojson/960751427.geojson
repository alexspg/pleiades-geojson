  "description": "Most 7th-century B.C. Assyrian inscriptions record that Nineveh had eight south- and east-facing gates: the Šamaš Gate was the fourth of these. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it and gave it the Akkadian ceremonial name Enlil-mukīn-palêya, which means \"The God Enlil Is the One Who Makes My Reign Firm.\"",
