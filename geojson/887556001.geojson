  "description": "Habıbuşağı (İzoli) was an Urartian fortress situated near Kömürhan, at the left shore of the river Euphrates in the Elazığ Province of eastern Turkey. Today it is covered by the reservoir behind the Karakaya dam. Habıbuşağı is best known on account of a rock inscription of the Urartian king Sarduri II, son of Argišti (eighth century BCE) which reports the expedition of Sarduri to this region. Habıbuşağı is, in fact, the westernmost known fortress of the Urartian kingdom.",
