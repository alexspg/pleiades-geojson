  "description": "Nineveh's western wall had seven (or eight) gates: the Step Gate of the Palace was the second gate from the northern city wall. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it sometime between 694 and 691 B.C. and he gave it the Akkadian ceremonial name Libūr-ēpissa, which means \"May Its Builder Endure.\" The gate is still unlocated, but, based on its everyday name Akkadian name mušlālum ša ēkalli (\"Step Gate of the Palace\"), it must have led up to Sennacherib's Palace on the citadel, perhaps up to the harem or its northern section.",
