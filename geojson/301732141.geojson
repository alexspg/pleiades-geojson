  "description": "The Neo-Assyrian king Ashurbanipal built a grand royal residence in the citadel of Nineveh. It was located north and east of the temples of the god Nabû (Ezida) and the goddess Ištar (Emašmaš), and it was constructed on the site of an older, smaller palace. Ashurbanipal referred to this palace as the bīt redûti (\"House of Succession\"); in scholarly literature, it is often referred to as the \"North Palace.\" A small portion of the once-grand Assyrian palace is still visible today.",
