  "description": "A Roman and Late-antique fort and quarry at Mons Claudianus (modern Jabal Faţīrah) and in the associated Deir Wadi Umm Hussein in Egypt's eastern desert. It is often referred to in scholarly literature and the press simply as \"Mons Claudianus\" because of its location. Excavations at the site are notable in part for the recovery of a large textual archive that details the operations and daily life of soldiers and workers at the site.",
