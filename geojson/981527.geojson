  "description": "The Roman province of Iudaea, incorporating the historical regions of Judea, Samaria, and Idumaea, was established in 6 CE, when the former tetrarchy of Herod Archelaus came under direct Roman administration. Following the Bar Kokhba War (132-135), Hadrian changed the province's name to Palaestina, and in the mid- to late 4th century CE the area was divided into three provinces (Palaestina Prima, Secunda, and Tertia or Salutaris).
