  "description": "Elmalık (formerly Zivistan, Zewestan) is a village in the Van Province in the southeast of Turkey ca. 12 km to the south of Van. Two small Urartian fortress have been found in the immediate vicinity, which are known as Aşağı Zivistan Kalesi (\"Lower Zivistan Castle\") and Yukarı Zivistan Kalesi (\"Upper Zivistan Castle\"). On the basis of several Urartian stone inscriptions of the Urartian king Išpuini (9th century BCE) (CTU I A 2-2 - A 2-4) and one rock inscription of the same king (CTU I A 2-5), both fortresses can be dated to the the reign of the Urartian king Išpuini (9th century BCE).",
