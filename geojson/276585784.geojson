  "description": "Near modern Khostia/Prodromos in Boeotia, Máli is the modern name of a peak on a ridgeline where extensive remains of an ancient site, possibly a \"refuge site\" for the polis of Khorsiai, have been discovered. The population of Khorsiai are thought to have relocated back to the original nucleus of the community at nearby Kástron Khostíon sometime in the early Archaic period.",
