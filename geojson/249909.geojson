  "description": "Rediscovered in the 19th century and partially excavated in the 1960s, this Roman-era complex east of modern Sorde-l'Abbaye (Landes, Nouvelle-Aquitaine in France) has been variously identified as a villa and a road station. Discoveries at the site included stone walls, a courtyard, a portico, baths, a mosaic floor, a bordering Roman-era roadway. A medieval church indicated in documents and early maps seems to have used some of the ancient structures. The site appears to be largely overgrown and inaccessible today.",
