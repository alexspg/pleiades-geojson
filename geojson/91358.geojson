  "description": "Hadrian's Wall or Vallum Aelium was the first of two Roman fortifications built across northern Britannia. The project was begun in A.D. 122 and the works eventually stretched from the River Tyne near the North Sea to the Solway Firth on the Irish Sea. The wall represented the northern limit of the Roman Empire.",
