  "description": "When Kalhu (biblical Calah, modern Nimrud) became the principal administrative center of the Assyrian Empire in the ninth century BC, king Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC) built (or rebuilt) numerous temples. The most important of those was dedicated to the god Ninurta, the patron deity of city, which Ashurnasirpal had constructed between his palace and the ziggurat, a building also consecrated to Ninurta.",
