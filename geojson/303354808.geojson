  "description": "This ornately-decorated, elevated building might have been the residence of Sammu-ramat (the legendary Semiramis) in the palace of her son Adad-nārārī III (r. 810-783 BC) at Kalhu (biblical Calah, modern Nimrud). Because these rooms were built noticeably higher than the surrounding area, its first excavator Austen Henry Layard believed that he had uncovered part of an upper floor of an Assyrian palace and, therefore, referred to this area as the “Upper Chambers.”",
