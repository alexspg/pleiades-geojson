  "description": "When Kalhu (biblical Calah, modern Nimrud) became the principal administrative center of the Assyrian Empire in the ninth century BC, king Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC) built (or rebuilt) numerous temples. One of those was dedicated to the god Ea and the goddess Damkina. Although its location is not known, the Ea-Damkina temple at Kalhu is thought to have been situated within the Ninurta temple complex, in the northwest corner of the citadel.",
