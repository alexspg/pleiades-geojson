        "description": "The Great Altar is an architectural enlargement of a known style. Appended to opposing sides of the Great Altar are two projected wings that are split by a wide set of stairs with an Ionic Collonade. Its highly decorative ornamentation, characteristic of the Baroque Hellenistic period, distinguishes the Great Altar from previous architecture. The large frieze sculpture on the platform supporting the altar is a lavish relief depicting gods at war. Many believe the altar was erected in celebration of victory in battles won at Pergamon. There is dispute over the exact date of construction, but most scholars agree it was built during the Kingship of Eumenes II (197-159 B.C.).",

        "description": "The remains of the Great Altar lay perched one of the terraces in the ancient city of Pergamon. First excavated in 1878 by Carl Humann and Alexander Conze, the remnants of the Great Altar were reconstructed at the Berlin Royal Museum. It is widely agreed upon that the remains were built during the reign of Eumenes II from 197-159 B.C., constructed as a symbol of victory over the Gauls in 167 B.C.; archaeologists universally agree that the altar was built before the death of the Attalid king in 133 B.C. There is dispute over who commissioned the construction of the altar. Many speculate that it was Attalos II in celebration of a military victory. A frequently studied attribute of the Altars is the detailed frieze under the platform depicting a gigantomachy of over 200 gods at war. Distinguished by the artistic depiction of movement and severe emotion, the relief sculpture is a noted example of the Hellenistic Baroque style. The name of the god, or gods, to whom the altar was dedicated has been lost in history; the exact military victory the temple represents, if any at all, is still debated. ",
