  "description": "Lugli describes the remains of a sumptuous, porticoed villa in the Doric order facing onto the Alban lake. Marzano clarifies Lugli's earlier summary of the site, which was in turn based on observations made in 1912. The remains of the villa include a 200-m long portico on two levels. About 260 m from the portico are the remains of a cistern in opus reticulatum. Chiarucci documented a structure with five barrel-vaulted rooms of unclear function. Lugli's initial report suggests that this late republican villa was eventually incorporated into the Villa of Domitian.",
