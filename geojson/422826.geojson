  "description": "The second highest summit of the Alban Hills, Mons Albanus is an extinct volcano with an elevation of 950 m (3,117 ft). In the middle of the first millennium B.C. there may have been volcanic activity as noted by the historian Livy. The mountain was sacred for Latin peoples who held important festivals there and a major shrine to Iuppiter Latiaris stands on the mountain top.",
