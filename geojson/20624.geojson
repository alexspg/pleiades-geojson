  "description": "An island mentioned frequently -- and often metaphorically -- in texts of the Roman period, said by Ptolemy, Strabo, Pliny, and others to lie to the north of Britannia. Some scholars associate it with the island known today as Shetland, but the geographic association even in antiquity (when it was more than just a rhetorical term) varied (see further Todd in New Pauly).",
