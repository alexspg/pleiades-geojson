  "description": "Most 7th-century B.C. Assyrian inscriptions record that Nineveh had eight south- and east-facing gates: the Aššur Gate was the second of these. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it and gave it the Akkadian ceremonial names Lilbur-iššak-Aššur (\"May the Vice-Regent of the God Aššur Endure\") and Libūr-iššak-Aššur (\"May the Vice-Regent of the God Aššur Stay in Good Health\").",
