  "description": "Colle Gentile is a naturally defensible hill with good visibility located in the environs of Norba. While the site has not been scientifically excavated, it has been surveyed. The Groningen Institute of Archaeology identified traces of polygonal masonry fortification walls as well as surface ceramics that indicate settlement activity associated with Archaic and Republican phases. Imperial period activity is absent.",
