  "description": "The Timpone della Motta is an archaeological site located near Francavilla Marittima. The site was inhabited from the Middle Bronze Age onward. During the Iron Age, an Oenotrian settlement flourished here, one that developed into an important sanctuary. The site passed into Greek control in the later seventh century B.C. and was eventually abandoned following the Bruttian conquest of the region during the fourth century B.C.",
