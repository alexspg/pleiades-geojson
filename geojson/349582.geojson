  "description": "Ptolemy lists this city (polis) first in a list \"between the two Syrtis's\". Some scholars have tentatively identified it with Zouchis (i.e., Taricheiai), attested in Strabo and Stephanus, and with Chouchis, attested in a fragment of Artemidorus of Ephesus. Mattingly (BAtlas) was unwilling to accept the equivalence, listing Chouzis as \"unlocated\", a decision followed here.",
