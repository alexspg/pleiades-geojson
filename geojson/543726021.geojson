  "description": "Anavarza Kalesi is a large fortress of Byzantine and Armenian date on probable Roman foundations. It shares its Turkish name with the 200m high limestone outcrop on which it stands. This outcrop served as the acropolis of ancient Anazarbos, and it also has been suggested as a location for the earlier \"Kundu,\" which is mentioned in Akkadian sources.",
