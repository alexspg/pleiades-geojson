  "description": "Remains of a rectangular Romano-Celtic temple were excavated north of the French town of Bû (in the department of Eure-et-Loir), beginning in the 1960s. Other buildings of uncertain nature and a theater were also identified in the vicinity. Coins and pottery discovered at the site indicate there was activity there during the Roman imperial period.",
