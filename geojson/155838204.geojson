  "description": "The Tang-i Var rock relief of the eighth-century-BC Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC) is carved on a rack face of the Kūh-e Zīnāneh in the Tang-i Var pass in Iranian Kurdistan, about 50 km southwest of Sanandaj and 85 km northwest of Kermanshah. This difficult-to-reach relief was carved in a niche cut into the cliff face about 40 m above ground level. The Akkadian inscription, now badly weathered, records several of Sargon II’s campaigns, especially the military expeditions against the land Karalla, against which the Assyrian army campaigned in 716, 713, and 706 BC.",
