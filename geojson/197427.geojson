  "description": "Ancient Parentium, now Poreč, Croatia, was a city on the western coast of the Istrian peninsula. There is archaeological evidence of Illyrian settlement from the Bronze Age onward. The site factors in Roman campaigns of the second century BC. The settlement became an oppidum civium Romanorum and then was advanced to municipium by Augustus. Tiberius dubbed it Colonia Iulia Parentium in the first century AD.",
