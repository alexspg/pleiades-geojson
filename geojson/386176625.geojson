  "description": "The so-called \"Kothon\" is a large, rectangular, artificial pool dating to the Punic period of Sicily and located on the island of Motya. Originally interpreted as an artificial port basin, recent research reinterpets it as a freshwater basin with functions sacred to the god Ba'al and constituting the central component of a large sanctuary.",
