  "description": "The seventh-century-BC Assyrian king Esarhaddon (r. 680–669 BC) started building a royal residence in the southwest corner of the citadel of Kalhu (biblical Calah, modern Nimrud). Sculpted and inscribed limestone slabs from the Central Palace (constructed by Tiglath-pileser III [r. 744–727 BC]) and the Northwest Palace (built by Ashurnasirpal II [r. 883–859 BC]) were used as building materials for this royal residence, which very likely remained unfinished at the time of Esarhaddon’s death in 669 BC. Its excavators called it the “Southwest Palace” since it was located in the southwest corner of the citadel.",
