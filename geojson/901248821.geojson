  "description": "B朝t-Karziabku was originally the name of a Kassite clan, which was named after its eponymous tribal ancestor Karziabku; the Akkadian name means \"House of Karziabku.\" By the reign of the Middle Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I (1125-1104 B.C.), B朝t-Karziabku had become district/region with several towns. It is presently unlocated, but may have been situated in or near the province of Namar, which some scholars suggest may have been in the Hamrin basin.",
