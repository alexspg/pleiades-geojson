  "description": "Qal’eh-i Imam (“Imam Fortress”), also call Qal’eh-i Marivan (“Marivan Fortress”), is one of the most important castles and fortresses in the Kurdistan Province, Marivan District, Iran. This now-ruined military fortification played a key role during the Safavid Period (1502–1737) and was an administrative venter of Ardalanians and Babanians rulers in Kurdistan. The discovery of a stele fragment of the Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC) in the drystone wall enclosing one of the buildings of the village Barqaleh might attest to a settlement there in the eighth century BC.",
