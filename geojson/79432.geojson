  "description": "Durobrivae was a fortified Roman garrison town that was located at what is now Water Newton, Cambridgeshire. The fort was placed at the point where Ermine Street crossed the River Nene. The name Durobrivae may be a Latinisation of the Brythonic term *Durobrīwās that translates to\"fort (by the) bridges\".",
