  "description": "Masada is a natural fortress in the Iudaean desert that overlooks the Dead Sea. It was the site of the standoff between Jewish rebels and the Roman army in A.D. 73. Herod the Great built a palace atop the citadel during his reign. Roman camps and siege works are still visible at the site, which is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.",
