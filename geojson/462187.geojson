  "description": "Drepanum, the modern Trapani, Sicily, is an ancient port city. The archaeological remains of the ancient city are meager. During the First Punic War, Hamilcar fortified the site. The Roman Republic lost a naval engagement near Drepanum in 249 B.C. but then prevailed in the battle of the Egadi islands in 241 B.C. The city was likely of censorial status thereafter.",
