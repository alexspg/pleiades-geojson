  "description": "Ancient Mutina (originally the Etruscan town Mutna), was first inhabited by Villanovans and later by Ligurians and the Gaulish Boii. The Boii sieged the city in 218 BC and later Mutina was re-established as a Roman colony (183 BC). It was an important city and played a role in the civil wars during the last decades of the Roman Republic.",
