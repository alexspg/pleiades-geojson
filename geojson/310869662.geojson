  "description": "The New Year’s House (or Akītu Temple) of Nineveh's tutelary deity Ištar appears to date back at least to the Middle Assyrian period (reign of Tukultī-Ninurta I). Its Sumerian ceremonial name is not preserved in extant cuneiform sources. This temple's exact location remains unknown and it is certain whether Ištar's Akītu Temple was located in the citadel or in the lower town.",
