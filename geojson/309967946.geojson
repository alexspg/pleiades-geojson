  "description": "Now lost, the so-called \"Isis Tomb\" was excavated at Vulci in the 19th century. Based on finds evidence, the tomb is traditionally dated ca. 625 to 550 B.C. Its traditionally assigned name is likely a misnomer, based on a contemporary identification of a bronze bust as representing the Egyptian goddess Isis. The subsequent back-filling of the tomb and uncareful recording at the time have caused the tomb's location to be lost to us.",
