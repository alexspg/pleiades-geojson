  "description": "This beautifully-decorated Assyrian palace is located just north of the Nab√ª temple Ezida, in the southeast quarter of the citadel of Kalhu (biblical Calah, modern Nimrud). The building likely served as the office and/or residence of several important individuals in the administration of the Assyrian Empire, probably including the governor of Kalhu. Numerous cuneiform tablets were discovered in three rooms north of the central courtyard. Because many of those Akkadian texts relate to the activities of several governors, British excavators in the 1950s dubbed the building the \"Governor's Palace.\"",
