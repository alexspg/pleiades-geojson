  "description": "The eighth-century-BC Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC) had several royal residences constructed in the citadel of his new capital, Dūr-Šarrukīn (modern Khorsabad). Residence M, which has constructed on the western side of the citadel, is presumed to have been for one of the highest officials of the Assyrian Empire. Since no inscriptions were discovered in the ruins of the building, the owner/principal occupant of the this Assyrian palace is not known.",
