  "description": "Sacred to the goddess Anna Perenna and the nymphs, this rectangular fountain surrounded by rupestral inscriptions was excavated on the modern Via Guidubaldo del Monte in Rome's Pinciano neighborhood during the late 20th century. Rich votive deposits complement the picture of the goddess' worship painted by Ovid in the Fasti entry for the Ides of March.",
