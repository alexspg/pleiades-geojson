  "description": "Perhaps formed to protest the annexation of Lycia by Rhodes, by 168â€“7 BCE the league appears to have gained quasi-autonomy under the domination of Rome. Although the league was a party to a treaty with Iulius Caesar in 46 BCE, by 43 CE the region was annexed by Claudius into the province of Lycia; the league survived and had authority over some local customs and legal matters.",
