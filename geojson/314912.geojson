  "description": "A center for Numidian royalty, Bulla Regia first became an oppidum liberum in the reign of Augustus and then a colony under Hadrian. The site, which boasts significant archaeological remains, lies in modern Tunisia, about 5km north of the modern city of Jendouba. The site was reportedly known in the 19th century as Hammam-Darradji. Today, a small modern settlement named AÃ¯n Babouch abuts the site (not to be confused with Babouch, which lies further north along the border with Algeria).",
