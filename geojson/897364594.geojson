  "description": "When Kalhu (biblical Calah, modern Nimrud) became the principal administrative center of the Assyrian Empire in the ninth century BC, king Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC) built (or rebuilt) numerous temples. One of those was dedicated to the goddess Gula. Although its location is not known, the Gula temple at Kalhu is thought to have been part of the Ninurta temple complex (in the northwest corner of the citadel), east of the Šarrat-niphi temple and north of the Kidmuri temple.",
