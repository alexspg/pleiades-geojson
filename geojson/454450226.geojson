  "description": "The temple of the god Sîn, Ekišnugal (“House of the Great Light”), was located in the Kullab district of Babylon, in the eastern half of the inner city. According to the Babylonian topographical text Tintir = Babylon Tablet IV, it was one of four temples in that part of Babylon. The temple is mentioned in Old Babylonian Period texts and was (re)built by the Old Babylonian king Abī-ēšuh (r. ca. 1711–1684 BC) and the Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604–562 BC). The temple survived into the Hellenistic Period.",
