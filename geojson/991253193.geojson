  "description": "A major kingdom in the region of Macedon/Macedonia. In 306 BCE the successors of Alexander III declared themselves as kings, effectively creating independent kingdoms. Lysimachus originally controlled the region of Macedonia with parts of Asia Minor; afterwards, Macedonia was briefly under the control of Seleucus I and Ptolemy Keraunos until the latter's death in 279 BCE. By 277 BCE Antigonus II Gonatas controlled the kingdom. It would remain under the Antigonid dynasty until the Romans defeated Perseus, the final Antigonid king, and dissolved the kingdom following the battle of Pydna in 168 BCE.",
