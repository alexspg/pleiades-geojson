  "description": "The “Shalmaneser Gate” gave access from the lower town of Kalhu to the citadel. This entrance, which was flanked by a pair of inscribed stone lions, was located on the east citadel wall, just north of the Nabû temple Ezida. This gate, which its excavators named after the ninth-century-BC Assyrian ruler Shalmaneser III (r. 858–824 BC), is assumed to have been the main east citadel gate, especially since a road ran between it and the armory (Fort Shalmaneser) located in the southwest corner of the city.",
