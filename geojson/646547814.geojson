  "description": "The temple of the goddess Gula, Esabad (“House of the Open Ear”), was located in the Tuba district of Babylon, in the western half of the inner city. According to the Babylonian topographical text Tintir = Babylon Tablet IV, it was one of three temples in that part of Babylon. Esabad was rebuilt by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (r. 668–ca. 631 BC) and Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604–652 BC). The temple survived into Arsacid times (247 BC–AD 224).",
