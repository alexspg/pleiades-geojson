  "description": "Based in Aetolia in central Greece, the Aetolian League was founded in the Hellenistic period to counter the power of Macedon and the Achaean League. It was allied with Rome in the First Macedonian War (215-205 BCE), but later was opposed to the republic in Rome's war against Antiochos (192â€“188 BCE). After Rome's victory in 188, the Aetolian League was fully subordinate to Rome.",
