  "description": "The Bēlet-ilī Gate, which was given the Akkadian ceremonial name Bēlet-ilī-murappišat-talittīšu (\"The Goddess Bēlet-ilī Is the One Who Increases Its (Animals’) Offspring\"), is the eighth of the eight city gates of Dūr-Šarrukīn (\"Fort Sargon\") listed by Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC) in inscriptions recording the construction of his new capital. This gate is the second of the south-facing entrances to the city, but its precise location remains unknown.",
