  "description": "Established in 280 BCE, the second Achaean League was centered in the northern and central Peloponnese. Allied to Rome in the Second Macedonian War (200-196 BCE), the league extended its control over all of the Peloponnese. In the Third Macedonian War (171â€“168 BCE) the League's relationship with Rome deteriorated; in ca. 146 BCE this led to open warfare, which resulted in the defeat and dissolution of the league.",
