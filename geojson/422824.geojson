  "description": "Alba Longa, located in the Alban Hills southeast of Rome, was the chief city and founder of the Latin League. Conflict with Rome caused Alba's destruction in the seventh century B.C. The legendary history of Romulus and Remus connects them to the royal lineage of the city. The ancient city is probably to be located at and around the site of modern Castel Gandolfo.",
