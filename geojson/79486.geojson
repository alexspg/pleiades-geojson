  "description": "The Gosbecks farm site is the location of a Romano-Celtic temple. The shrine measures 100 meters square and a pre-Roman enclosure lies within the later temenos. The pre-Roman site was likely sacred to the war-god Camulos. Camulos was later synchronized with the Roman god Mars, although evidence for the worship of Mercury was also discovered at the site.",
