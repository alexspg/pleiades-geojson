  "description": "An ancient fortified complex located on a natural outcropping of the Taurus mountains near the modern village of Tırnak in the Gülnar district of Turkey's Mersin Province. Identified as KRS (Kirsi/Kirshu) in neo-Babylonian chronicles, the site continued to be occupied and used into the Hellenistic period when it was destroyed and abandoned around 235 BCE. There is some evidence for reuse of the site in the Byzantine period.",
