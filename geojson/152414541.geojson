  "description": "The Ištar Gate, which was given the Akkadian ceremonial name Ištar-mušammeḫat-nišīšu (\"The Goddess Ištar Is the One Who Makes Its People Flourish\"), is the sixth of the eight city gates of Dūr-Šarrukīn (\"Fort Sargon\") listed by Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC) in inscriptions recording the construction of his new capital. This gate is the second of the west-facing entrances to the city, but its precise location is uncertain.",
