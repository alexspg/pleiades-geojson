  "description": "Tell ‘Acharneh is located 35 km northwest of Hama, on the north bank of the Orontes River, at the crossroads of two main trade routes. This center for the production of oil, wax, and wheat was occupied during the Bronze and Iron Ages, as well as during the First Crusades. Its ancient name, Tunip, is known from second-millennium-BC sources. A stele fragment bearing an inscription of the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721–705 BCE) found there attests to the city’s occupation during the Iron Age.",
