  "description": "The site of Ilici began as a pre-Roman settlement that eventually developed into a Roman municipium. The site continued into the Visigothic and Byzantine periods as a minor urban settlement, controlling a vast territory which reached old Lucentum. The settlement was relocated to the modern site of Elche in the Islamic period.",
