  "description": "The Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604–562 BC) constructed a new royal residence for himself at Babylon. This grand palace was constructed north of the so-called “South Palace,” the traditional royal residence of the kings of Babylon. The building, which is referred to as the “new palace” (ēkallu eššu) in Achaemenid-period texts, is generally called the “North Palace,” “Nordburg,” and “New Palace.”",
