  "description": "This modern village in Turkey's Şanlıurfa province is the site of a subterranean complex discovered in 2017 and only partially excavated. The excavated portion of the complex can be dated to the Neo-ssyrian period, thanks to the presence of an unfinished, rock wall panel depicting a divine procession with some divine figures labeled in Aramaic.",
