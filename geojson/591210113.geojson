  "description": "A community within the territory of Colophon. Although there is some controversy as to its status, the name suggests that the community was founded by slaves (or other dissidents) who supported Aristonikos against Rome between 133 and 130/129 BCE. It seems to have been reabsorbed by Colophon at an undetermined point after 130/129. Its location is unknown today.",
