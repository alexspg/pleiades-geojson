  "description": "Most 7th-century B.C. Assyrian inscriptions record that Nineveh had eight south- and east-facing gates: the Handūru Gate was the first of these.  The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it and gave it the Akkadian ceremonial name Šarur-mušamqit-ayyāb-šarri (\"The God Šarur Is the One Who Cuts Down the King's Enemy\"). This unlocated gate is now generally thought to have been located near southwest corner of the city.",
