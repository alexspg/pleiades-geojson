  "description": "A peripteral Doric temple built in the mid-6th c. BCE and destroyed by fire in the 2nd c. BCE. The temple faces east, and was built of mudbrick on foundations of local sandstone, with sandstone column drums and a terracotta roof. A 4th c. BCE dedicatory inscription found in the cella attests the worship of Apollo. The structure was discovered in 1994 following the activity of looters.",
