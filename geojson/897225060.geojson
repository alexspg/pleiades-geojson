  "description": "The outer wall of Babylon was called by the ceremonial Akkadian name Nēmed-Enlil/ Nēmetti-Enlil, which means \"Bulwark of the God Enlil.\" According to the text Tintir = Babylon, Nēmed-Enlil (and the inner wall Imgur-Enlil) had eight city gates, four on the eastern side of the Euphrates and four on the western side of the river. The Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal and the Babylonian kings Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar II, and Nebonidus all undertook construction on Babylon’s outer wall. ",
