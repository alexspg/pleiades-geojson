  "description": "The Prytanikon was the seat of the Prytaneis and was located on the west side of the Agora in proximity to the Old Bouleuterion, with which it formed an architectural unit. This structure was supplanted by the later Tholos and its remains are referred to as \"Building F\". It dates to the later period of the Peisistratids, ca. 550-525 B.C.",
