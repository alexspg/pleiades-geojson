  "description": "The Makra Teiche or \"Long Walls\" of Athens were built in the middle of the fifth century B.C. and connected Athens to its ports at Piraeus and Phalerum. They were destroyed by the Spartans after the Athenian surrender in 403 B.C., and rebuilt during the beginning of the Corinthian War, which started in 395 B.C. The walls were ultimately destroyed by Sulla during his siege against Athens in 86 B.C.",
