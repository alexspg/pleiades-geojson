The city was founded by the Thracian king Seuthes III in the late fourth century BC and served as the capital of the Odrysian kingdom. Located near the modern city of  Казанлъ̀к (Kazanlak) in Bulgaria, the site was excavated in the 1940s and subsequently submerged by the filling of the Koprinka reservoir.",
