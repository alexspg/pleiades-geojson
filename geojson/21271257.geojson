  "description": "The Ea Gate, which was given the Akkadian ceremonial name Ea-muštēšir-nagbīšu (\"The God Ea Is the One Who Keeps Its Spring(s) in Good Order\"), is the seventh of the eight city gates of Dūr-Šarrukīn (\"Fort Sargon\") listed by Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC) in inscriptions recording the construction of his new capital. This gate is the first of the south-facing entrances to the city, but its precise location remains unknown.",
