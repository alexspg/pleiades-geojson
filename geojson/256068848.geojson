  "description": "Excavations for Rome's Metro C public transit line at the Amba Aradam Station revealed the remains of a second century A.D. barracks connected with the Praetorian Guard, along with a domus identified as that of a praetorian commandant. Although ruinous, the architectural complex demonstrates good preservation of some features, notably floor mosaics and wall paintings. The second century A.D. stratigraphic horizon was reached at a depth of approximately 12 meters.",
