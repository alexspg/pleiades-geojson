  "description": "The Thermae Helenianae or Thermae Helenae was a thermal complex located in the Horti Spei Veteris, also referred to as the Horti Variani. The baths were situated near the arcus Neroniani adjacent to the Amphitheatrum Castrense. As Helena, mother of Constantine I, restored them following a fire in 323-326, they are named for her.",
