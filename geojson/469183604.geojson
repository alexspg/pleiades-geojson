  "description": "A famous ancient sanctuary of Poseidon located at the southern end of the modern Mani peninsula of the Peloponnese. Literary and archaeological evidence indicate that the sanctuary featured a temple, a cave treated as a mouth of the underworld, and other structural and monumental components. It seems to have served as a sanctuary site for suppliants and a context for the formal manumission of enslaved persons.",
