  "description": "Blanda was an ancient city of Lucania, although Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy differ as to its placement; the former places it near the coast, the latter inland. Modern scholars are in agreement that Ptolemy was incorrect. It is to be identified with the significant archaeological site at Palecastro di Tortora in modern Italy.",
