  "description": "Ayanis (or Ayanıs, now Ağartı Kalesi) is an Urartean fortress and settlement located 35 km north of Van on a rocky outcrop 250 m above Lake Van (1867 m above sea level). It was founded in the 7th century BCE under Rusa, son of Argišti, and was named Rusahinili Eidurukai (\"The City of Rusa in front of Mount Eiduru\"). Here two inscriptions of Rusa, son of Argišti (7th century BCE), have been found which report that Rusa cultivated the barren land, built the fortress and the city as well as a “tower temple” (“susi temple”) and a “Gate for the God Haldi” (A 12-01 and A 12-09).",
