  "description": "Korakou is a hill located on the Corinthian Gulf near New Corinth. It rises to 35 m above sea level. Carl Blegen conducted excavations at the site in 1915 and 1916. Archaeological remains show continuous use from the Early Helladic (EH) to Late Helladic periods (LH). It is suggested that the site served as a Mycenaean emporion. By the Archaic period the abandoned site gives way to burials.",
