  "description": "A large temple dedicated to Artemis at the city of Sardis in western Asia Minor. A sanctuary to Artemis was constructed on the site during the Persian Era (ca. 547-334 BCE), and construction on a new temple on the site began during the third century BCE. The temple was never fully completed. A small church was built on part of the site in the 5th century CE, but the structure declined from the 7th century onwards, and many of its stones were reused or burned.",
