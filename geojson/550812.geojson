  "description": "An important ancient settlement, located at modern Bergama in Turkey. It was first described in Xenophon's Anabasis and was later used as a treasury under Lysimachus. Pergamum became the administrative capital and principal city of the Attalid kingdom and dynasty (282-133 BCE) and was briefly the first capital of the Roman province of Asia. It later was a seat of a Christian bishopric and is listed in Revelation as one of the seven churches of Asia. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014 under \"Pergamon and its Multi-Layered Cultural Landscape\".",
