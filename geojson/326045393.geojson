  "description": "The Agora was the main civic square of the town. It was an enclosed space (ca. 202 x 72 m) surrounded by Ionic porticos on all sides. A fragmentary architrave inscription from the double north colonnade records its dedication by C. Julius Zoilos, the leading figure in the town in the 30s and 20s B.C.",
