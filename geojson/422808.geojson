  "description": "The toponym 'Ad Duas Lauros' refers to a large imperial property at the third mile of the Via Labicana and today comprised of the archaeological park of Centocelle. The site is mentioned in the Liber Pontificalis as that of a large imperial villa in which Helena, mother of Constantine I, lived. Archaeological work conducted in the late 1990s identified the remains of substantial Republican period villas in the same area, with evidence of both elite dwellings and viticulture. The villas identified are the Villa della Piscina and the Villa Ad Duas Lauros.",
