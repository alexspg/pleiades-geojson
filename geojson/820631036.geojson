  "description": "The Obelisk of Theodosius is an ancient Egyptian obelisk that was originally erected by Pharaoh Thutmose III (1479â€“1425 BC) to the south of the seventh pylon of the great temple of Karnak. The emperor Theodosius I had the obelisk relocated to Constantinople after AD 390 and it was subsequently re-erected on a newly commissioned sculpted base on the spina of the city's hippodrome.",
