  "description": "A kingdom or federation in western Anatolia, whose exact location(s) and extent are matters of scholarly debate. The presence and nature of Arzawa is gleaned primarily from Hittite royal annals and diplomatic texts of the LBA, as well as the two letters from Amarna between Amenhotep III and the king of Arzawa. These texts, however, do not reveal the temporal span of Arzawa, and should be treated as snapshots in time. Arzawa reached its greatest prominence in the middle of the fourteenth century BCE, but had been reduced to a rump state by the end of the century. The remaining territory formed the core of the kingdom of Lydia.",
