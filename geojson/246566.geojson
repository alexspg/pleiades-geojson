  "description": "In 71 BC as Pompey returned to Italy from Iberia he set up a monument in the Pyrenees known as the Pompei Tropaea. This monument commemorated the 876 cities Pompey had conquered. Pompey's monument was spoliated in late antiquity and a medieval church and later priory were built on the site. Spoliated in turn, what is left of all these structures now comprises the Sitio arqueológico de Panissars on the French/Spanish border.",
