  "description": "Nineveh’s main (or great) inner wall was called Badnigalbilukurašušu (\"Wall Whose Brilliance Overwhelms Enemies\"). It was constructed by the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib after he moved the Assyrian capital to Nineveh. Badnigalbilukurašušu’s superstructure was reportedly raised to a height of 200 courses of brick. The visible remains of the twelve-kilometer-long wall and some of its gates are still visible today.",
