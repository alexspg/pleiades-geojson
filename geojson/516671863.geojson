  "description": "The influential Neo-Assyrian queen Naqi’a built a royal residence for her son Esarhaddon in the citadel of Nineveh. This palace, which may have served as a summer residence for the Assyrian king and his mother, remains unlocated. It is certain from contemporary Akkadian inscriptions that the palace was constructed near the Sîn-Šamaš temple, but the exact location of that temple is not known.",
