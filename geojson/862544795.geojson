  "description": "Mound site along the eastern bank of the Euphrates in northern Syria. The site shows signs of habitation from the Early Bronze Age through the Byzantine period. Tell el-ʻAbd was flooded by the construction of the Taqba Dam in 1975, though a portion of it has reemerged due to declining water levels in Lake Assad.",
