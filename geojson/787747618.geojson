  "description": "Bismaya, ancient Adab, is a major archaeological mound in southern Iraq. The site is located in the present-day Wāsiṭ Province about 65 kilometres south of al-Kūt. Excavations by E.J. Banks from 1903-05 uncovered extensive remains of the ancient city of Adab, predominantly dating to the 3rd and early 2nd millennium BCE. In its day, Adab was renowned especially for its temple, the Emaẖ, dedicated to the goddess Ninẖursag.",
