  "description": "This Roman road station \"at the Pyrenees\" or \"Top of the Pyrenees\" is attested in inscriptions, the Antonine Itinerary, and the Peutinger Map. It was located at the Coll del Pertús, a pass now on the modern French/Spanish border, and modern scholars tend to assume it was coincident with (or very near) the modern border town of Le Perthus.",
