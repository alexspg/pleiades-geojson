  "description": "Archaeological site on the eastern bank of the Euphrates in northern Syria. The site contains a town dated to the Early Bronze Age III-IVA (mid-3rd millennium BCE), as well as a Roman sanctuary used only briefly from about the late 1st-late 2nd century CE. The western part of the site was flooded by the construction of the Tischrin Dam in 1999. Tall Bazi and the nearby site of Banat have been tentatively identified as the city of Armi/Armium mentioned in texts from Ebla.",
