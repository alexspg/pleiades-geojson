  "description": "The fifth Augustan administrative region of the city of Rome, the Esquiliae took its name from the Esquiline Hill. It includes parts of the Oppian and Cispian hells, as well as areas outside of the Servian agger. Its northern limits were marked by the Vicus Patricius and the Clivus Suburanus bounded it to the east. The fourth-century sources estimate the region's perimeter as 15,600 Roman feet (approximately 4.61km). In addition to the named monuments, Regio V contained 15 aediculae (shrines), 180 domÅ«s (patrician houses), 22 horrea (warehouses), 75 balneae (baths), and 74 fountains.",
