  "description": "An ancient sanctuary of Hercules (Melqart) that Strabo places at one end of the long island (Cotinussa) that extended south from ancient Gades. Significant landscape and coastal change have occurred since antiquity, disrupting the integrity of these islands. Nonetheless, modern scholars have consistently identified the location of the sanctuary as at or near the 17th-18th century Castillio de Sancti Petri, which today occupies a separate homonymous islet. Archaeological finds possibly associated with the sanctuary have been made in the vicinity (both terrestrial and underwater) over the years, but precise location of foundations or other identifiable architecture have remained elusive.",
