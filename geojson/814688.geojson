  "description": "Iathrippa was an oasis settlement along the Incense Road. From the Roman period until the advent of Islam the site was the seat of influential Iudaeo-Arabian tribes. Iathrippa would become an important center of Islam. Muhammad fled here from Mecca in 622 and the site was renamed Al-Madīna. It remained a key center until 656. It is the site of Muhammad's grave and a place of Muslim pilgrimage.",
