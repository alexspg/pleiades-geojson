  "description": "Akkad (Māt-Akkadî) is the name of a historical region of central Mesopotamia (northern Babylonia). During the Sargonic/Akkadian Period (ca. 2334-2113 B.C.), its capital was the city of Agade, which may have been located somewhere near the confluence of the Diyala and Tigris Rivers. In cuneiform texts of the first millennium B.C., the term Māt-Akkadî was used for the name of the region roughly comprising the northern half of Babylonia, now modern-day central Iraq.",
