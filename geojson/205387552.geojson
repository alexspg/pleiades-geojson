  "description": "The so-called House of Iulia Felix (II, 4, 3) is situated on the south side of the Via dell'Abbondanza, near the Palaestra and the Amphitheater. The estate was formed from two complete insulae that were merged. About one-third of the area was occupied by the house, the remainder by a large garden. Following the AD 62 earthquake the proprietress seems to have leased out portions of the property.",
