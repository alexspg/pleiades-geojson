  "description": "One of the four main Buddhist pilgrimage sites, identified as the place where Gautama Buddha attained Enlightenment. The first temple on the site was built by Emperor Asoka in the third century B.C., and the present temple dates from the fifth or sixth centuries. It is one of the earliest Buddhist temples built entirely in brick, still standing in India, from the late Gupta period. The site was largely abandoned from the twelfth-eighteenth centuries. It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002.",
