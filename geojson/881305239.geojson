  "description": "The Civita Giuliana is located in the northern suburbium of Pompeii, about 700 meters from the city walls. Thus far the site has produced archaeological evidence of suburban villas in Pompeii's hinterland. Early twentieth-century excavations were carried out here, only to be published in 1994. Clandestine looting at the site brought about a cooperative effort to resume excavations in the interests of heritage protection in 2017.",
