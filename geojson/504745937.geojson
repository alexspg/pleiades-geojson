  "description": "Tel Kisson, also known as Tell Keisan, is an archaeological site located 8 km from the Mediterranean shoreline in Israel's Galilee region. Human occupation at the site of the tel begins in the Chalcolithic period. By the middle Bronze Age, the site was prosperous and fortified. It experiences possible destruction in the twelfth century BCE and recovers, though at a reduced scale. From the later eleventh century BCE, the site is occupied as perhaps an economic enclave of Phoenician Tyre.",
