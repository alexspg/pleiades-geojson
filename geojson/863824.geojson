  "description": "The river Terek flows through the Darial Gorge in eastern Georgia along the flank of Mount Kazbek. This natural pass was known by many names in antiquity, including the Caspian Gates, the Caucasian Gates, and the Gates of Iberia. It was also referred to as the Gates of the Sarmatians and the Gates of the Alans. The latter name provides the source for the current toponym describing the gorge itself. Anderson 1928 notes that \"Caspian Gates\" (Caspiae portae) is used to refer to at least three locations in the ancient sources, with the Darial Gorge being one of those.",
