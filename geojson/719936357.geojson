  "description": "Most 7th-century B.C. Assyrian inscriptions record that Nineveh had eight south- and east-facing gates: the Halahhu Gate was the eighth and last of these. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it and gave it the Akkadian ceremonial name Bābilat-ḫiṣib-huršānī, which means \"The Bearer of the Produce of the Mountains.\"",
