  "description": "The Neo-Babylonian kings Nabopolassar (r. 625–605 BC) and Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604–562 BC) constructed an outer wall around the eastern side of Babylon. That mudbrick wall is reported to have had 120 towers and 5 entrances, including the Giššu Gate. This access point to the city was probably located on the southeastern stretch of the wall.",
