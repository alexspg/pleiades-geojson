  "description": "The so-called \"Sacellum of the Augustales\" at Misenum is an architectural complex located near the theater that was first built during the Iulio-Claudian period and dedicated to the Imperial cult. The complex was renovated during the second century, at which time one Cassia Victoria re-dedicated the shrine in honor of her husband, L. Laecanius Primitivus, who was a priest of the Augustales during the reign of Marcus Aurelius.",
