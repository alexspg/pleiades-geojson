  "description": "Assyria, a region of Upper Mesopotamia that formed the heartland of the Assyrian Empire. The region was known as Subartu prior to the rise of the city-state of Aššur, the first capital of the Assyrian Empire. Other major cities of the region include Nineveh (the later capital of the Empire), Dur-Sharrukin, and Kalhu. After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 609 BCE, the region fell under the control of a succession of other powers, generally remaining as a coherent administrative region. This persisted until the seventh century when the Rashidun Caliphate incorporated the former Sasanian province of Asōristān within the larger province of al-Jazira.",
