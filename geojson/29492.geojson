  "description": "Aššur, later Māt Aššur ('the land of the god Aššur'), grew from a small city-state and important trading center to a powerful, wide-spread empire. At is zenith in the seventh century BC, the Assyrian Empire (883-609 BC) dominated much of the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean, stretching from the Persian Gulf in the south to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Assyria's heartland, an area also referred to as Subartu, roughly corresponds to northern Iraq (Nineveh Governorate) and includes the numerous important cities, especially Aššur (Assyria's traditional religious and administrative capital), Kalhu, Dur-Šarrukin, and Nineveh (the capital of the Assyrian Empire).",
