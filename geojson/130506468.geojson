  "description": "Nineveh's western wall had seven (or eight) gates: the Armory Gate (later Step Gate of the Armory) was the fifth gate from the northern city wall. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it and gave it the Akkadian ceremonial names Pāqidat-kalāma (\"The One Who Regulates Everything\") and Lū-dāri-bānûša (\"May Its Builder Live Forever\").",
