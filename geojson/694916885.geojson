  "description": "Soria is located on the Duero river in north-central Spain. Inhabited in pre-Roman times by the Arevaci, the site became prominent in the eleventh century as it was positioned near the border between Muslim-controlled lands and those controlled by Christians. It was  absorbed into the Kingdom of Le√≥n in 1134 and later (thirteenth century) belonged to the kingdom of Alfonso X.",
