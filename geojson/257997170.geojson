  "description": "Qumasi is a Quean fortress located on the Cilician plain. In the eighth century BC, perhaps only for a short time, Phrygia controlled the territory in which Qumasi was located. The Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721-705), after his armies defeated the Phrygian king Midas (= Mit√¢ of Musku), restored Qumasi to Que, which was then a province of the Assyrian Empire.",
