  "description": "The Seleucid Empire was a Hellenistic kingdom, founded by Seleucus I Nicator, and ruled by the Seleucid dynasty from 312 to 63 BCE. At its height it stretched from the Aegean Sea to northern India, but it steadily lost territory and prestige. The remnants of the kingdom were eventually incorporated into Roman territory as the province of Syria in 64 BCE. ",
