  "description": "Numidia was an ancient region of North Africa. From the late third century B.C. to 40 B.C. the territory was controlled by the ancient kingdom of the Numidians. It later became a Roman client state. Numidia was located in what is now Algeria, as well as parts of Tunisia and Libya in the Maghreb. In pre-Roman terms the polity was divided between the Massylii in the east and the Masaesyli in the west.",
