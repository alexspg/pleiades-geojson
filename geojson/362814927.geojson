  "description": "Uršu/Waršuwa was an Assyrian trading colony (kārum) located on the route between Aššur and Kaneš. This important city is attested in Eblaite and Sumerian sources, including an inscription of Gudea of Lagaš that describes the rebuilding of the temple of the god Ningirsu at Girsu; numerous Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian texts; and Hittite sources, for example, the annals of king Hattusili I, a literary composition generally referred to as ‘The Siege of Uršu,’ a treaty between the Hittite king and Sunassura of Kizzuwatna, and a land grant to a nobleman (Sahurunuwa).",
