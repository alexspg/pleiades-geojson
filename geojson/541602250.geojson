  "description": "The Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II constructed for himself a large and ornately decorated palace, the ruins of which are still visible today. This extensive architectural complex was located in the Kadingirra district of Babylon, which is situated just south of the Ishtar Gate, east of the processional street Ay-ibūr-šabû, north of the Lībil-hengalla canal, and west of the Euphrates River. Several Akkadian inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar II record the construction of this building.",
