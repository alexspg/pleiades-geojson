  "description": "Paracata, also known as Başbulak and Bulakbaşı, is situated near Taşburun in the Kars province in eastern Turkey. Here a stone block with an inscription of the Urartian king Minua (9th / 8th century BCE) was found, in which he claims to have built the building to which the stone block belonged. Furthermore, Minua states that he has built a fortress at this place and given it the name \"Minuahinili\" (i.e. \"The Minuan“).",
