  "description": "The Neo-Babylonian ruler Nabopolassar (r. 625–605 BC) started planning and constructing an outer wall around the eastern side of Babylon. This massive mudbrick brick wall, together with its protective quay wall and a wide moat, remained unfinished at the time of Nabopolassar’s death. His son and successor Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604–562 BC) finished the work started by his father. Traces of Babylon’s once-impressive eastern outer wall are still visible today.",
