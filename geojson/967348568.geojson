  "description": "The northern city wall of Nineveh had three gates: the Sîn Gate was the westernmost of the three. The Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib constructed it and called it the Gate of the Garden, which was given the Akkadian ceremonial name Igisigsig-mušammeh-ṣippāti (\"The God Igisigsig Is the One Who Makes Orchards Flourish\"). Late in 695 B.C. or early in 694 B.C., the gate was dedicated to the moon-god Sîn and renamed Nannāru-nāṣir-agê-bēlūtīya (\"The Divine Nannāru Is the One Who Protects My Lordly Crown\").",
