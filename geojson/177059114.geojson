  "description": "Palace complex constructed by Constantine I in 330 CE that served as the primary residence of the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Emperors until 1081 CE. Use of the palace declined beginning in the 11th century, and it had been abandoned by the time of the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Most of the structure was demolished in the early Ottoman period. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque was built on the primary site of the palace in the early 17th century. ",
