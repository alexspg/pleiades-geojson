  "description": "The multi-phase acropolis of Etruscan Volaterrae has numerous important phases, beginning in the Archaic period. The monumental site continued to develop and grow during the Hellenistic period. It was identified archaeologically only in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century it was the subject of major investigations under M. Cristofani and, later, M. Bonamici.",
