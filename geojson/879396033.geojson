  "description": "Around 690 B.C., the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib started construction on a New Year’s Temple for Nineveh’s tutelary deity Ištar. Ešahulezenzagmukam, whose Sumerian ceremonial name means \"House of Joy and Gladness for the Festival of the Beginning of the Year\" was never completed and work on it appears to have come to a complete stop ca. 688 B.C., when Sennacherib decided to rebuild the Akītu Temple at Ashur instead.",
