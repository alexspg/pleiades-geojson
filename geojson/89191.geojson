  "description": "A Roman fort located along the Roman road from Brougham to Ravenglass. The previous association with Ambleside is now in doubt since the discovery of a diploma at Ravenglass in 1995, which plausibly links Itunocelum with Ravenglass, and consequently making Ambleside more likely to be identified with *Glannoventa.",
