  "description": "The ninth-century-BC Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (r. 858–824 BC) constructed an impressive palatial complex in the southeastern corner of the city Kalhu (biblical Calah). This armory, which the seventh-century-BC ruler Esarhaddon (r. 680–669 BC) referred to as an ēkal māšarti (‘review palace’), was completed ca. 846 BC. Fort Shalmaneser, the name of building dubbed by its excavators, remained in use until the very end of the Assyrian Empire (612 BC), although its importance was significantly diminished after the Assyrian court moved away from Kalhu at the end of the eighth century BC, first to Dūr-Šarrukīn and then to Nineveh.",
