  "description": "An ekal māšarti (arsenal or review palace), constructed in the lower town of the city of Kalhu by Shalmaneser III. The building was completed by about 846 BCE. Its primary use lasted until the imperial capital moved to Dur Sharrukin in 710 BCE, though it maintained some degree of occupation until the end of the Assyrian Empire in the late seventh century BCE.
