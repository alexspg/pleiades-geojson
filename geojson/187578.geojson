  "description": "Tergeste (the modern Trieste) was first a vicus dependent on Aquileia (ca. 100 BC) and later became a colony under Caesar, sometime before 52 B.C. In the Augustan reorganization of Italy, the city was part of the Decima Regio and then of Venetia et Histria. By Late Antiquity, it had become a bishopric.",
