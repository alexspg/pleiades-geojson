  "description": "The Romans assumed control of Tergeste (the modern Trieste) in 177 B.C. Its pre-Roman history was that of an Illyrian settlement, while its Roman experience saw it become a vicus dependent on Aquileia (ca. 100 BC) that eventually received a colony under Iulius Caesar. In the Augustan reorganization of Italy the city was part of the Decima Regio and then of Venetia et Histria. By Late Antiquity it became a bishopric.",
