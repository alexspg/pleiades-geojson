  "description": "Near the middle of the citadel of Kalhu (biblical Calah, modern Nimrud), the ninth-century-BC Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883â€“859 BC) constructed a building with a grand, south-facing entrance. This building, constructed east of the southeast corner of the Northwest Palace, might have been one of the temples built by Ashurnasirpal II when he made Kalhu the administrative capital of the Assyrian Empire. Alternatively, the Central Building might have served as a palace.",
