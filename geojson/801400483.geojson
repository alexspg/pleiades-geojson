  "description": "Bath building originally occupying all of Block F3, located in the intramuros military sector of Dura-Europos. Excavations reveal that the bath likely had two phases of renovation (one perhaps after 165 CE, and another around c. 200 CE), before it was destroyed by fire. Dura-Europos' amphitheater was built over the remains of Bath F3, and thus the amphitheater's dedicatory inscription, dated to 216 CE, serves as a terminus ante quem for the bath building.",
