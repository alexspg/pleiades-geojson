  "description": "A small oasis lying about 60 km north west of Kharga, on the escarpment outlining the depression. It was the only water source along the Darb Ain Amur, one of the two tracks that linked Kharga and Dakhla. The archaeological remains consist of a Late Period stone temple and a  large cemetery. Surveyed between 2006 and 2011 by the North Kharga Oasis Survey project.",
