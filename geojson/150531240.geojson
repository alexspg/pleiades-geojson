  "description": "Shisheh is a village in the Ahar county of the East Azerbaijan Province of Iran, situated about 40 km northeast of the city Ahar. Near the village a rock inscription of the Urartean king Argišti II, son of Rusa, has been found (A 11-6). The inscription reports a military campaign of Argišti to the land Arhu (which is apparently the name the Urartians used for the respective region). Furthermore, Argišti states that he built a fortress named “stronghold of the god Haldi” (Haldiei irduši) and a city at this place.",
