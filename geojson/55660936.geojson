  "description": "Priniatikos Pyrgos is located on a limestone headland jutting out into the southwest corner of the Gulf of Mirabello in East Crete. Ongoing survey and excavation in the vicinity is producing evidence of occupation from at least the Late Neolithic down through the Late Roman and Byzantine periods. Whatever ancient names may have been applied to these settlements are as yet unknown.",
