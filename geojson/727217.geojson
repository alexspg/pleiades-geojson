  "description": "Sais was an ancient Egyptian town located in the Western Nile Delta on the Canopic branch of the Nile river. It served as the provincial capital of Sap-Meh, the fifth nome of Lower Egypt, and became a capital during the Twenty-fourth Dynasty (ca. 732â€“720 BC) as well as during the Late Period. Herodotus claimed that Osiris was buried at Sais. Other Greek authors, including Plato, maintained a connection between Sais and the goddess Athena.",
